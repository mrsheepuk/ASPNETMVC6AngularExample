# ASP.NET vNext / MVC6 Angular Example
Basic ASP.NET vNext MVC6 Angular example with easy gulp tooling. Not finished yet, but has the following features:

1. Gulp to handle minification, combination, and injection of the JS and CSS into the view.
2. Separate dev / production JS inclusions injected automatically.
3. Small selection of gulp tools to ensure Angular JS is injected in the right order etc.

Todo:

1. Use bowerFiles or similar to automatically include the relevant artifacts from the selected bower components rather than manually specifying.
2. Actually create a small Angular app!
