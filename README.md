# ASP.NET 5 / MVC 6 Angular Tutorial

This is a simple, opinionated, tutorial to show how to create an Angular (v1.5) single page application with an ASP.NET 5 / MVC 6 Web API back end, using Visual Studio 2015 on Windows. There are hundreds of different ways of writing Angular applications, many good, a lot bad. This guide takes you through creating an application using one particular style, based on the guidelines set forth in the excellent [Angular Style Guide by John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

This tutorial won't talk about other ways you can structure your Angular code, but it is worth being aware that other examples elsewhere on the internet may use differing styles which might look radically different to that presented here - confusion may lie that way!

The basic empty project provided on the master branch of this repository has the following features:

1. Gulp to handle minification, combination, and injection of the JS and CSS into the view.
2. Separate dev / production JS inclusions injected automatically.
3. Small selection of gulp tools to ensure Angular JS is injected in the right order etc.

To follow the tutorial, which starts from the master branch in this repository and creates a small Angular application interacting with a simple REST interface implemented in WebAPI, head over to [the web pages](http://mrsheepuk.github.io/ASPNETMVC6AngularExample/) and follow the instructions!

You can see the different stages of completion of the tutorial in the branches in this repository.
