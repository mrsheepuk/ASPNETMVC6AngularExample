# ASP.NET 5 / MVC6 Angular Tutorial
This is a basic ASP.NET 5 MVC6 Angular tutorial using easy gulp tooling. The empty project has the following features:

1. Gulp to handle minification, combination, and injection of the JS and CSS into the view.
2. Separate dev / production JS inclusions injected automatically.
3. Small selection of gulp tools to ensure Angular JS is injected in the right order etc.

To follow the tutorial, which starts from this repository and creates a small Angular application interacting with a simple REST interface implemented in WebAPI, head over to [the web pages](http://mrsheepuk.github.io/ASPNETMVC6AngularExample/) and follow the instructions!

Different branches in here represent the different stages of completion of the tutorial.
